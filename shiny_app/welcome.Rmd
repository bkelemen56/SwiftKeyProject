## Welcome to yawmr!

**yawpr** (yet another word predictor for R) is the ultimate prediction algorithm implemented in the `R` language. 

It was developed to allow fast real-time word predictions within a simple web based user interface.

Key features of the program:
- N-gram Language Model trained from 1, 2, 3 and 4-grams 
- Incremental model training for large corpus
- Fast prediction of the next word
- Simple user interface

Use options from the left to explore the application.

**Welcome!** displays this page.  

**Predict words** takes you to the predict words section, from where you’ll be able to type sentences/words, and when you type a space, yawpr will predict the next word and up to 4 additional options. The predicted words are clickable so you can continue to type/predict.

Additional help is available under **Need help?** section.

**Source code** takes you to my github repo for this project.

Enjoy!
