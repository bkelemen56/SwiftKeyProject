## Welcome to yawpr!

**yawpr** (yet another word predictor for R) is the ultimate prediction algorithm implemented in the `R` language. 

It was developed as part of Coursera's Capstone project for the Specialization in Data Science to allow fast real-time word predictions within a simple web based user interface.

Key features of the program:
- N-gram Language Model trained from 1, 2, 3 and 4-grams 
- Incremental model training for large corpus
- Fast prediction of the next word
- Simple user interface

Exploratory data analysis is available at https://rpubs.com/bkelemen/swift_key_report_1.

The application is accessible at http://bkelemen.shinyapps.io/pnw_app.

Enjoy!
